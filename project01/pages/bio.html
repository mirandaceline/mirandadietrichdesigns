			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>I was born in Orange, California in 1995. My father was in the navy so we lived in Virginia for a short amount of time until moving back to the city of La Habra where I was raised and attended high school. I was always an artistic kid dabbling in all forms of art. It was until my high school art teacher would recommend I look into typography thus began my journey into the graphic design world. I would describe my self as someone who is at first a little shy but once I am comfortable Iâ€™m expressive and outgoing. My hobbies include drawing, baking vegan goods, taking photos, socializing with friends, camping, roller skating, thrifting, and hanging out with my pups. I hope for my future that I am working in a graphic design job that I enjoy waking up everyday to go to. Some place where creative expression is accepted and encouraged.</p>
