<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>My name is Miranda Dietrich and I'm 24 years old. I was born in Orange, California and moved to Virgina Beach soon after. I was always an artistic kid dabbling in all forms of art. Art for me has always been a great way to express myself. It was until my high school art teacher would recommend I look into typography thus began my journey into the graphic design world. Other than art, my interest include living a meat free lifestyle and baking vegan goods. I also enjoy film photography as another  hobbie.I express myself through my clothing. Working at a buy, sale, trade store, I come across a lot of unique items of clothing. That's where most of money goes toward. I have two amazing dogs named Winnie and Baby who I love very much. My life at the moment consist of school, work, and surrounding myself with amazing people. </p>
			<h4>Where I Come From?</h4>
			I was born in Orange, California in 1995. My father was in the navy so we lived in Virginia for a short amount of time until moving back to the city of La Habra where I was raised and attended high school. 
			<h4>How I define myself?</h4>
			 I would describe myself as someone who is at first a little shy but once I am comfortable I’m expressive and outgoing. My family would describe me as loud and someone who has no filter. I would hope that people see me as kind person. 
			<h4>What I Like?</h4>
			 My hobbies include drawing, baking vegan goods, taking photos, socializing with friends, camping, roller skating, thrifting, and hanging out with my pups. 
			<h4>What Am I Going To do In The Future?</h4>
			I hope for my future that I am working in a graphic design job that I enjoy waking up everyday to go to. Some place where creative expression is accepted and encouraged.
			<h4>My Design Philosophy</h4>
			My design philosophy for Graphic Design would be to create meaningful designs that must use visual problem solving and critical thinking. I believe in hierarchy and a strong relationship between elements within my designs and how they interact with one another. I also believe that one must be extremely imaginative to create a design that will stand out among the rest but also be able to draw back on being overly ‘out there’. Overall, I think graphic design is all about balance to produce a design that is readable and interactive.
